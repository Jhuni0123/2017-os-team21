config GENERIC_PHY
	bool "PHY Core"
	help
	  Generic PHY support.

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface for PHY
	  devices present in the kernel. This layer will have the generic
	  API by which phy drivers can create PHY using the phy framework and
	  phy users can obtain reference to the PHY. All the users of this
	  framework should select this config.

	default y if ARCH_S5PV210 || ARCH_EXYNOS
	help
	  Support for MIPI CSI-2 and MIPI DSI DPHY found on Samsung S5P
	  and EXYNOS SoCs.

	  Support for Display Port PHY found on Samsung EXYNOS SoCs.

config PHY_SAMSUNG_USB2
	tristate "Samsung USB 2.0 PHY driver"
	select GENERIC_PHY
	select MFD_SYSCON
	help
	  Enable this to support the Samsung USB 2.0 PHY driver for Samsung
	  SoCs. This driver provides the interface for USB 2.0 PHY. Support for
	  particular SoCs has to be enabled in addition to this driver. Number
	  and type of supported phys depends on the SoC.

config PHY_EXYNOS4210_USB2
	bool "Support for Exynos 4210"
	depends on PHY_SAMSUNG_USB2
	depends on CPU_EXYNOS4210
	help
	  Enable USB PHY support for Exynos 4210. This option requires that
	  Samsung USB 2.0 PHY driver is enabled and means that support for this
	  particular SoC is compiled in the driver. In case of Exynos 4210 four
	  phys are available - device, host, HSIC0 and HSIC1.

config PHY_EXYNOS4X12_USB2
	bool "Support for Exynos 3250/4x12"
	depends on PHY_SAMSUNG_USB2
	depends on (SOC_EXYNOS3250 || SOC_EXYNOS4212 || SOC_EXYNOS4412)
	help
	  Enable USB PHY support for Exynos 3250/4x12. This option requires
	  that Samsung USB 2.0 PHY driver is enabled and means that support for
	  this particular SoC is compiled in the driver. In case of Exynos 4x12
	  four phys are available - device, host, HSIC0 and HSIC1.

config PHY_EXYNOS5250_USB2
	bool "Support for Exynos 5250"
	depends on PHY_SAMSUNG_USB2
	depends on SOC_EXYNOS5250
	help
	  Enable USB PHY support for Exynos 5250. This option requires that
	  Samsung USB 2.0 PHY driver is enabled and means that support for this
	  particular SoC is compiled in the driver. In case of Exynos 5250 four
	  phys are available - device, host, HSIC0 and HSIC.

	tristate "Exynos5 SoC series USB DRD PHY driver"
	depends on ARCH_EXYNOS5 && OF
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	select GENERIC_PHY
	select MFD_SYSCON
	help
	  Enable USB DRD PHY support for Exynos 5 SoC series.
	  This driver provides PHY interface for USB 3.0 DRD controller
	  present on Exynos5 SoC series.
